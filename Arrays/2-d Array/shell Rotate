You are given a n*m matrix where n are the number of rows and m are the number of columns. You are also given n*m numbers representing the elements of the matrix.
You will be given a ring number 's' representing the ring of the matrix. For details, refer to image
You will be given a number 'r' representing number of rotations in an anti-clockwise manner of the specified ring.
You are required to rotate the 's'th ring by 'r' rotations and display the rotated matrix.

// LOGIC

- First pick the shell elemebts and keep in One-D array
- Rotate the 1-D array by R rotations
- Again put the one-D array elements in the shell
- print the complete 2-D array
